# Portfolio Review: Fitriaji Taqiy Robbaanii (Ajitaro)

## Overall Assessment: Needs Revision

This portfolio effectively showcases a capable mid-to-senior level Software Engineer with valuable experience in performance optimization and CI/CD. However, it is undermined by a critical lack of attention to detail that damages its credibility. The core content is strong, but the unprofessional errors are significant enough to warrant immediate revision.

## Strengths

1.  **Excellent Project Framing:** The portfolio clearly and safely describes professional experience at a high, feature-driven level. It successfully communicates the *what* and the *impact* of the work (e.g., "Optimized Product Catalogue load time (~10s → ~1s)") without disclosing confidential information.

2.  **Strong Technical Depth:** The experience listed goes beyond basic application development. Topics like performance optimization, CI/CD automation with CodePush, and leading TypeScript adoption are compelling indicators of a skilled engineer who can handle complex, senior-level challenges.

3.  **Clear Role Progression:** The history at "Ruparupa" (from Intern to Engineer) tells a compelling story of growth, trust, and increasing responsibility within a single organization, which is a strong positive signal to recruiters.

## Red Flags & Risks

1.  **Critical Typo (High Risk):** The employment period **"Sep 2025 – Present"** is a major error that immediately signals a lack of attention to detail. A reviewer may stop reading here, assuming the entire portfolio is careless.

2.  **Incomplete Information (Medium Risk):** The placeholder social media links (`#`) for LinkedIn and GitHub make the portfolio appear unfinished and unprofessional. Recruiters expect these links to be functional.

3.  **Confusing Categorization (Low Risk):** Placing "Coding Teacher" under the `EDUCATION` section is illogical and dilutes the impact of the formal degree. It creates a moment of confusion for the reader.

## Concrete Recommendations

1.  **Correct the Employment Date:** Immediately change **"Sep 2025"** to the correct year. This is the most critical fix.

2.  **Add Context to Accomplishments:** To elevate the content to a senior level, add a brief narrative (1-2 sentences) to each key achievement explaining the **challenge** and the **decision-making process**.
    *   *Example (Before):* "Optimized Checkout load time (~12s → ~1s)"
    *   *Example (After):* "Optimized Checkout load time (~12s → ~1s) by identifying and deferring non-critical API calls and implementing client-side caching. This approach was chosen over server-side rendering to minimize backend load."

3.  **Update Contact Links:** Replace the placeholder `"#"` URLs in the `CONTACT` section with the correct, live URLs for the author's LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

4.  **Re-categorize "Coding Teacher":** Create a new top-level section called `"Community"` or `"Volunteering"` and move the "Coding Teacher" experience there. This presents the information more logically and professionally.

5.  **Frame Contributions in a Team Context:** While the individual contributions are clear, adding context about team collaboration would strengthen the narrative. For instance, "Led a front-end team effort to adopt TypeScript..." provides a more complete picture of work in a professional environment.
